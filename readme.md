Very basic video editing/composing software done as an extension to a university project.
The initial project was to create a superimposed image where all the moving parts of the original images would be placed in the final image.

the .mlapp files include the functionality for basic video editing, including composing functions, basic effects (colour correction, blurs etc),
colour channel manipulations etc. The application supports rendering as JPEG, PNG and TIFF sequences.
